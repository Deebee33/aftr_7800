# Chapter 3 Data Visualization

Using ggplot this chapter will focus on the grammar used to specify the layers of the graph

## req materials 
+ Tidyverse (datasets, ggplot pkg)



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
usually this loads a list of packages (ggplot, tibble, tidyr, ect) sometimes the functions of these overlap those of base R or other loaded pkgs`tidyverse_conflicts()`. in that case R chooses the one loaded latest and masks the other. when this masking/overlap occurs just use the syntax `specific_pkg:: function ()` to specify the function and package you mean.

## working /w `mpg` dataframe

using ggplot: 
+ Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines? 
+ What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like? Is it positive? Negative? Linear? Nonlinear?

mpg contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

```{r}
view(mpg)
mpg

```
plot the data from mpg, disp vs hwy

```{r}
#make a plot with mpg data, map x n y with displ and hwy. then (+) add points based on displ and hwy with geom point specifying scatterplot
displ_vs_hwy<-ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point()
#or specify a plot of mpg data, then (+) apply the scatter plot layer (geom point) map x and y with displ and hwy
displ_vs_hwy_b<-ggplot(mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
displ- a car’s engine size, in litres.
hwy- a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg).
```{r}
displ_vs_hwy_b
```
as engine size increases (displ) highway mpg decreases (hwy)

Its easier to think of ggplots commands as layers with specifications 
so first you start with `ggplot()` to specify this as a plot
then you add your data as `data = mpg` and using `geom_point` to specify a scatterplot
designate your axes and values with aes and specifying your independent as displ and dependent as hwy 
`ggplot(data=mpg, mapping= aes(displ, hwy))+ geom_point`

does displ affect hwy?

another way is to call ggplot to draw a plot 
designate your data as mpg`ggplot(mpg)`
specify axes and aesthetics with aes x is displ, y is hwy
add geom_point to add scatterplot layer to graph where x n y have been designated `ggplot(mpg)+geom_point(mapping=aes(displ, hwy))`

## general graphing template
`ggplot(data= <dataset>) + <geom__ graph type>(mapping= aes(<x,y mappings>))`

## Aesthetic mapping

An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. You can display a point in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. Since we already use the word “value” to describe data, let’s use the word “level” to describe aesthetic properties. Here we change the levels of a point’s size, shape, and color to make the point small, triangular, or blue

there are 6 outliers on the right side of the displ vs hwy showwing unusually high hwy miles per gallon 
we can highlight this by adding an additional aes mapping based on class 

```{r}
displ_hwy_class<-ggplot(mpg)+ geom_point(aes(displ, hwy, color= class))
```


alternative
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color= class)) + geom_point()
```
To map an aesthetic to a variable, associate the name of the aesthetic to the name of the variable inside `aes()`.ggplot2 will automatically assign a unique level of the aesthetic (here a unique color) to each unique value of the variable, a process known as scaling. ggplot2 will also add a legend that explains which levels correspond to which values.

aesthetic options include size,shape,color,alpha/transparency

For each aesthetic, you use aes() to associate the name of the aesthetic with a variable to display`color=class`. The aes() function gathers together each of the aesthetic mappings used by a layer and passes them to the layer’s mapping argument.- figure a better way to say this

You can also set the aesthetic properties of your geom manually. For example, we can make all of the points in our plot blue

```{r}
bluepts<-ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
bluepts
```
