# Chapter 3 Data Visualization

Using ggplot this chapter will focus on the grammar used to specify the layers of the graph

## req materials
+ Tidyverse (datasets, ggplot pkg)



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
usually this loads a list of packages (ggplot, tibble, tidyr, ect) sometimes the functions of these overlap those of base R or other loaded pkgs`tidyverse_conflicts()`. in that case R chooses the one loaded latest and masks the other. when this masking/overlap occurs just use the syntax `specific_pkg:: function ()` to specify the function and package you mean.

## working /w `mpg` dataframe

using ggplot: 
+ Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines? 
+ What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like? Is it positive? Negative? Linear? Nonlinear?

mpg contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

```{r}
view(mpg)
mpg

```
plot the data from mpg, disp vs hwy

```{r}
#make a plot with mpg data, map x n y with displ and hwy. then (+) add points based on displ and hwy with geom point specifying scatterplot
displ_vs_hwy<-ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point()
#or specify a plot of mpg data, then (+) apply the scatter plot layer (geom point) map x and y with displ and hwy
displ_vs_hwy_b<-ggplot(mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
displ- a car’s engine size, in litres.
hwy- a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg).
```{r}
displ_vs_hwy_b
```
as engine size increases (displ) highway mpg decreases (hwy)

Its easier to think of ggplots commands as layers with specifications 
so first you start with `ggplot()` to specify this as a plot
then you add your data as `data = mpg` and using `geom_point` to specify a scatterplot
designate your axes and values with aes and specifying your independent as displ and dependent as hwy 
does displ affect hwy?
another way is to call ggplot to draw a plot
designate your data as mpg
specify axes and asthetics with aes x is displ, y is hwy
add geom_point to add scatterplot layer to graph where x n y have been designated
