This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Working my way through the Learnr tuitorial (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) on top of data camp lessons and biol7800 (introtodatascience)

# Chapter 3 Data Visualization

Using ggplot this chapter will focus on the grammar used to specify the layers of the graph

## req materials
+ Tidyverse (datasets, ggplot pkg)



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
usually this loads a list of packages (ggplot, tibble, tidyr, ect) somtimes the functions of these overlap those of base R or other loaded pkgs`tidyverse_conflicts()`. in that case R chooses the one loaded latest and masks the other. when this masking/overlap occurs just use the syntax `specific_pkg:: function ()` to specify the function and package you mean.

## working /w `mpg` dataframe

using ggplot: 
+ Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines? 
+ What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like? Is it positive? Negative? Linear? Nonlinear?


```{r}

```
